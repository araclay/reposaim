# Problem Solving & Being Lazy
 



What does being lazy have to do with solving any problems?
 _Surely_ if you're lazy, no problems will get solved, right?





**Wrong.** 
Well, depending on your definition of of being lazy, of course. 
If you think in the traditional sense of being a couch potato, not doing any work,
 then yeah, no problems are getting solved. Sorry to burst that bubble. 



However, if you think of being lazy as not _wanting_ to do masses of work, 
but still willing to produce a decent end result, then yes, problems will be solved.

 

_Being lazy, can make things easier for you._




Who wants to look at a massive task, and try to tackle it headfirst, rather than breaking
 it down into smaller chunks, and doing lots of little tasks. After all, twenty three small
 tasks makes it sound like you've done more work than one larger task, even if the workload 
might be the same. 

But, being lazy doesnt mean you don't do anything. Weigh up the outcomes,
 make the best decision for your work.
 _Think of the long term._ Is quickly programming something, rushing to get it finished, 
worth the complaints and phonecalls you're going to recieve on down the line, when
 your shoddy programming job is broken by some hacker? No, it's not. Doing a good job
 in the first place, and putting effort in so you don't have to fix it later is probably
 the best bet in that case. Don't make your life difficult.
